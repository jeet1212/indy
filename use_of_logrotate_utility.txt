Including new service logs to logrotate

Use below steps when you want to use logrotate linux utility to rotate the log files of your application.
 
Step 1:

/home/app/logs/app_datao2_search.log
  are being created inside /home/app/logs
 directory that needs to be rotated on daily basis. 

First we need to create a new logrotate configuration file to accommodate for our new log file:

Logged-in with sudo user (sudo su) and create below file,
 
vi /etc/logrotate.d/app_datao2_search

Step 2: 

Insert a following text into /etc/logrotate.d/app_datao2_search:

/home/app/logs/app_datao2_search.log {
missingok
notifempty
compress
daily
rotate 7
create 0777 www-data www-data
}

Please note, if you have multipple log files are created in the logs dir for a project, you can use *.log

missingok - don't output error if log file is missing
notifempty - don't rotate log file if it is empty
compress - Old versions of log files are compressed with gzip(1) by default
daily - ensures daily rotation
rotate - Log files are rotated count times before being removed or mailed to the address specified in a mail directive. If countis 0, old versions are removed rather than rotated.
create - creates a new log file with permissions 777 where owner and group is the root user
 
Use below command to test/rotate log file manually,
sudo logrotate  -f /etc/logrotate.d/app_datao2_search
